## Introduction

This front-end assignment involved building a web application to manage leaves, where employees can view their leaves balance and history. The main goal was to create a user-friendly interface that allows employees to access and track their leaves easily.

I'm excited to showcase my work on this assignment and share the details of my approach and implementation.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Requirements:**

   - I carefully reviewed the assignment requirements to gain a clear understanding of what was expected in the final deliverable. This helped me identify the key features and functionalities to be implemented.

2. **Technology Stack Selection:**

   - I chose React.js as the front-end framework due to its robustness and popularity in the industry.
   - Vite was selected as the bundler for its fast development and build times.
   - For styling, I used Tailwind CSS to create a clean and responsive user interface.

3. **Project Setup and Structure:**

   - I set up the project structure using Vite, following best practices to organize components, styles, and assets.
   - I used npm as the package manager to manage project dependencies.

4. **Design and User Interface:**

   - The mockup for the design and user interface has been provided by Masscode Sdn. Bhd

5. **Component-based Development:**

   - I adopted a component-based development approach to ensure reusability and maintainability of the codebase.
   - Each component was designed and implemented with a single responsibility, promoting code modularity.

6. **Leaves Balance and History Functionality:**

   - I implemented the logic to fetch leaves data from the server and displayed it in the respective components.
   - The radial progress component was used to visualize the remaining leaves balance.
   - React Router was employed to handle client-side routing, allowing smooth navigation between leaves balance and history pages.

7. **Testing and Bug Fixing:**

   - I conducted thorough testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
   - The application was tested on different devices and browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

8. **Deployment:**
   - The completed project was deployed on Vercel to make it accessible for review.
